<h3>A picture I like</h3>
<img src="Images/mountain.jpg" height="360" width="480">
<p>This is a beautiful picture of a mountain taken by National Geographic that I like very much.</p>
<p>I love to watch nature scenery, but since I don't often get the chance to travel to beautiful untouched natural places, these pictures are amazing.</p>
